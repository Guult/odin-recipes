        <li>100g shaved milk chocolate</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Equipment</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>8 inch square baking tin</li>
        <li>cherry pitter</li>
        <li>speed peeler or vegetable peeler</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Instructions</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350F fan forced. Grease and line an 8 inch square baking tin with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Pit the cherries and chop into quarters. Set aside 1/2C fore the topping. Add the rest to the bowl with 1Tbsp of white sugar. Set aside to macerate for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the butter and chocolate in a heat proof bowl and microwave for 30 seconds at a time stirring between each until melted and smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place the eggs and both of the remaining sugars in a large bowl. Whisk with a handheld mixer for around 2 minutes. Until light and fluffy (or in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment for 3 to 5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add the melted chocolate and butter and the vanilla and stir through with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Sift over the plain flour, cocoa, and salt stirring with a spatula until just combined.</li>
        <li>Use a fork to lightly mash the macerated cherries, then stir them through the brownie batter.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into a prepared tin and bake for around 40 to 45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out with some sticky crumbs on it.</li>
        <li>Let them cool completely before proceeding. You can speed this up by chilling them in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Whip the cream in a bowl until it can hold a soft peak, then spread over the top. Dot with remaining cherries then scatter with chocolate shavings.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><h3>Notes</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>I use a standard Australian 20ml Tbsp, which is equal to 4tsp.</li>
        <li>For best results, you should always weigh ingredients like flour and sugar.</li>
        <li>Brownies are done when a toothpick comes out with a few sticky crumbs on it. They will carry-over bake in the tin.</li>
    </ul>
