    <p><img src="../img/choc-chip.jpg" alt="oozing chocolate chip cookie right out of the oven" width="450" height="500"></p>
    <p>If you are a fan of Penn Station's chocolate chip cookies, with huge chunks of chocolate chips, then you'll love this recipe. This recipe uses dark chocolate and semi sweet chocolate chips to give it that perfect balance of sweet and bitter. The taste is of a rich buttery cookie with solid hits of bitter dark chocolate. If dark chocolate isn't your favorite don't be put off as the sugar in the cookie balances this out perfectly.</p>
